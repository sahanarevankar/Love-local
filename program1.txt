This Python function, length_of_last_word, takes a string s as input, and its purpose is to find and return the length of the last word in the string.

Here's a detailed explanation of the logic:

Split the string into words: The split() method is used to divide the input string into a list of words. The default separator is any whitespace.

Check if there are any words: The function checks if the list of words is empty. If there are no words, it means the input string was empty or only contained whitespace. In such cases, the function returns 0.

Return the length of the last word: If there are words in the list, the function returns the length of the last word. It does this by accessing the last element of the list using words[-1] and then calculating its length with len().

Algorithm:

Split the input string s into a list of words using split().
If the list of words is empty, return 0.
Otherwise, return the length of the last word in the list using len(words[-1]).
The provided code takes user input for a string, calls the length_of_last_word function, and prints the result.
