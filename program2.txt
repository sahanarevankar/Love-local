Initialization: Initialize two candidate elements (candidate1 and candidate2) and their corresponding counters (count1 and count2) to None and 0.

First Pass - Find potential candidates: Iterate through the list (nums). For each element:

If it matches candidate1, increment count1.
If it matches candidate2, increment count2.
If count1 is 0, set candidate1 to the current element, and set count1 to 1.
If count2 is 0, set candidate2 to the current element, and set count2 to 1.
If neither of the above conditions is met, decrement count1 and count2.
Second Pass - Check the counts: Iterate through the list again. Count occurrences of candidate1 and candidate2.

Result Compilation: Check if the count of each candidate is greater than ⌊n/3⌋. If yes, add them to the result list.

Return the result list: The function returns a list containing elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times in the input list.

Algorithm:

Initialize candidate1, count1, candidate2, and count2 to None and 0.
Iterate through the list to find potential candidates and update their counts.
Iterate through the list again to count occurrences of potential candidates.
Check if the counts of candidates exceed ⌊n/3⌋ and add them to the result list.
Return the result list.
The provided code takes user input for a list of integers, calls the majority_elements function, and prints the result.
