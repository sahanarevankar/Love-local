Here's the detailed logic:

Initialization: Initialize a counter variable count to 0.

Loop through numbers from 1 to n: Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Count occurrences of '1': Convert each number to a string (str(i)) and count the occurrences of the digit '1' using the count method.

Update the total count: Add the count of '1's in the current number to the overall count.

Return the final count: After the loop, return the total count.

Algorithm:

Initialize count to 0.
Loop through numbers from 1 to n.
For each number, convert it to a string and count the occurrences of '1'.
Update the total count with the count of '1's in the current number.
After the loop, return the final count.
The provided code takes user input for a number, calls the count_digit_one function, and prints the result.
